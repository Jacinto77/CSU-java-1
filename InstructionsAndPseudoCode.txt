Option #1: List Individual's Name and Address Information

Demonstrate understanding of basic programming concepts by:

    Developing pseudocode that prints the following information for a fictional person:
        First name
        Last name
        Street address
        City
        Zip code
    Creating a simple java application that will print the items listed above on individual lines.

Compile and submit your pseudocode, source code, and screenshots of the application executing the application,
the results and GIT repository in a single document.

Pseudocode:
assign value for first name to string variable 'firstName'
assign value for last name to string variable 'lastName'
assign value for street address to string variable 'address'
assign value for city to string variable 'city'
assign value for zip code to int variable 'zip'
print to console the value of firstName plus lastName
print to console the value of address
print to console the value of city
print to console the value of zip
    optionally, cast to string (but unneeded)
